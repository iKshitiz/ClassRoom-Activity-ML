# Classroom Activity Profiling 


### Methodology

- For implementation, we are using an array of air quality sensors for measuring different
environmental parameters inside the classroom along with a sound sensor for measuring sound
intensity levels. 

- We are grouping dataset by mean per minute for all given data. Thereafter we are calculating statndard deviation for all single point of grouped data set with respect to a certain frame or time. 

- That standard deviation will be our feature set to train the model and predict the same.

- we are using Appropriated supervised technique identify underline patterns in acquired dataset. Afterwards the same will be used for modeling classifier for automated event identification.

- We are using statistical classification model rather than advanced machine learning algorithm to classify events.
